Contribution of team members:-
	Both the questions were done out of interest and all of us came up with individual solutions for both
        the quetions as a challenge for each other.
	We helped each other and came with best solution possible



Instructions to run the program:-

Please include the "input.txt" file and It can be easily run in command prompt
using "python Asn02P01.py input.txt".



Detils on example invocation and output:-

Let us take the following inputs
2
-3
1.5
-1
3
-2
-3
3
The output is:- 
The subsequence with max sum is  [1.5, -1.0, 3.0]  and the sum is  3.5




Challenges faced:-
We could not come up with the proper implementation for finding the subsequences but over some study 
finally came up the the solution


Things we learnt from our assignment:-
The concept of divide and conquer
Different ways the use command line arguements
Time complexity
